# API, REST & API REST

## API (Application Programming Interface)

Set of rules and specifications that describes how a system can communicate with others. It must be implemented in a clear and explicit way to facilitate the exchange of information, it allows the colaboration between systems developed in different languages.

An API can have an graphic interface or be used internally.
An API should be fully documentated in detail and how to interact with it.

## REST (REpresentational State Transfer)

The REST architectural style emphasises the scalability of interactions between components, uniform interfaces, independent deployment of components, and the creation of a layered architecture to facilitate caching components to reduce user-perceived latency, enforce security, and encapsulate legacy systems.

## API REST

 - It doesn't posses a graphic interface
 - Used only to connect systems via HTTP
